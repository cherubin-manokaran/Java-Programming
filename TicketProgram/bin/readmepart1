Ticket Program

Implements the following classes:
RegularTicket.java
WalkupTicket.java
AdvanceTicket.java
StudentAdvanceTicket.java

Tests classes using TestTicket.java client program

The program was designed to create a ticket system. 
The program represents four types of tickets: regular, walk-up, advance and student advance tickets.
It assigns the appropriate prices for each type of ticket.
If advance tickets, the number of days in advance are recorded and price assigned appropriately.
It also prints the ticket number, price, and type.

The client program creates an array of tickets of each type. 
For advance and student advance tickets, the number of days in advance are assigned.
Total profit is calculated by finding the sum of the prices and printed.
